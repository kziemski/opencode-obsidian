## Ideas

### Skills

This repository should contain a set of Agent Skills that can be enabled from the settings page.

### AGENTS.md initialization

OpenCode could be asked to generate initial AGENTS.md file for the vault, based on a template/prompt.

### "Native" Obsidian integration

Implement custom UI connecting to OpenCode server in order to have a seamless integration with Obsidian (clickable links, etc). This would be nice but also quite tedious (would need to re-implement large chunks of OC UI). Not sure if this is worth the effort.

Status: on-hold
